### JPMorgan-Chase-Co.-Virtual-Internship-M-A-Analyst

### Summury
This repository contains the completed project files and documentation from my virtual internship experience as an M&A Analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., offered through the Forage platform. During this internship, I gained hands-on experience in financial analysis, valuation, and the mergers and acquisitions process.

Key highlights of the internship include:
- Conducting financial due diligence and analysis on potential acquisition targets
- Developing detailed valuation models using DCF and comparable company analysis methodologies
- Creating comprehensive presentation materials, such as pitch books and management presentations
- Collaborating with a virtual team to deliver high-quality deliverables within tight deadlines

Through this experience, I strengthened my technical skills in financial modelling, valuation, and data analysis while also enhancing my soft skills in communication, teamwork, and adaptability. The projects completed during this internship showcase my ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios and provide valuable insights to support strategic decision-making in the M&A process.
